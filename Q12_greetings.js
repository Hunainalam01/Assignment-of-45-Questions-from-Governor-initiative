// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of
//  just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each
//   message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// Question no 12:-
var names = ["Misbah", "Ammar", "Wazeer", "Saba", "Kawish"];
console.log("AOA ".concat(names[0], " Just wanted to ask do you want to learn TS!"));
console.log("AOA ".concat(names[1], " Just wanted to ask do you want to learn TS!"));
console.log("AOA ".concat(names[2], " Just wanted to ask do you want to learn TS!"));
console.log("AOA ".concat(names[3], " Just wanted to ask do you want to learn TS!"));
console.log("AOA ".concat(names[4], " Just wanted to ask do you want to learn TS!"));
